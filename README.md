## Business problem

In this notebook we analyze a marketing campaign for a subscription based product. We look at different factors to check the effectivesness of the campaign while also looking to find anormalities and improvements we can make to it.

## Data source

- [DataCamp Marketing Campaign](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/analyzing-marketing-campaigns-with-pandas)

## Methods

- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering
- Data visualization
- Summary statistics
- A/B Testing

## Tech Stack

- Python (refer to requirement.txt for the packages used in this project)
- pandas (data manipulation and analysis)
- numpy (mathematical operation on arrays)
- matplotlib (data visuaization)

## Analysis

1. **Overall performance of the campaign**: We can analyze the number of conversions, retention rates, and cancellations to understand how successful the campaign was. We can also calculate key performance indicators such as conversion rate, retention rate, and churn rate.

2. **Performance by marketing channel**: We can analyze how each marketing channel performed in terms of conversions, retention, and cancellations. We can also calculate conversion rates and retention rates for each channel.

3. **Performance by variant**: We can analyze how the personalization variant performed compared to the control group in terms of conversions, retention, and cancellations. We can also calculate conversion rates and retention rates for each variant.

4. **Performance by language**: We can analyze how each language performed in terms of conversions, retention, and cancellations. We can also calculate conversion rates and retention rates for each language.

5. **Performance by age group**: We can analyze how each age group performed in terms of conversions, retention, and cancellations. We can also calculate conversion rates and retention rates for each age group.

6. **Performance by day of week**: We can analyze how the campaign performed on each day of the week in terms of conversions, retention, and cancellations. We can also calculate conversion rates and retention rates for each day of the week.

7. **Performance by subscribing channel**: We can analyze how each subscribing channel performed in terms of conversions, retention, and cancellations. We can also calculate conversion rates and retention rates for each subscribing channel.

8. **Correct language displayed**: We can analyze how displaying the correct language affected conversions, retention, and cancellations. We can also calculate conversion rates and retention rates for the correct language displayed.

Top 3 models (with default parameters)

| Model     	                | Recall score 	|
|-------------------	        |------------------	|
| Support vector machine     	| 88% 	            |
| Gradient boosting    	        | 90% 	            |
| Adaboost               	    | 79% 	            |



- **The final model used for this project: Gradient boosting**
- **Metrics used: Recall**
- **Why choose recall as metrics**:
  Since the objective of this problem is to minimize the risk of a credit default, the metrics to use depends on the current economic situation:

  - During a bull market (when the economy is expanding), people feel wealthy and are employed. Money is usually cheap, and the risk of default is low because of economic stability and low unemployment. The financial institution can handle the risk of default; therefore, it is not very strict about giving credit. The financial institution can handle some bad clients as long as most credit card owners are good clients (aka those who pay back their credit in time and in total).In this case, having a good recall (sensitivity) is ideal.

  - During a bear market (when the economy is contracting), people lose their jobs and money through the stock market and other investment venues. Many people struggle to meet their financial obligations. The financial institution, therefore, tends to be more conservative in giving out credit or loans. The financial institution can't afford to give out credit to many clients who won't be able to pay back their credit. The financial institution would rather have a smaller number of good clients, even if it means that some good clients are denied credit. In this case, having a good precision (specificity) is desirable.

    ***Note***: There is always a trade-off between precision and recall. Choosing the right metrics depends on the problem you are solving.

    ***Conclusion***: Since the time I worked on this project (beginning 2022), we were in the longest bull market (excluding March 2020 flash crash) ever recorded; we will use recall as our metric.


 **Lessons learned and recommendation**

- Based on this project's analysis, income, family member headcount, and employment length are the three most predictive features in determining whether an applicant will be approved for a credit card. Other features like age and working employment status are also helpful. The least useful features are the type of dwelling and car ownership.
- The recommendation would be to focus more on the most predictive features when looking at the applicant profile and pay less attention to the least predictive features.

## Limitation and what can be improved

- Combine this model with with a regression model to predict how much of a credit limit an applicant will be approved for.
- Hyperparameter tuning with grid search or random search.
- Better interpretation of the chi-square test
- Retrain the model without the least predictive features



## Run Locally
Initialize git

```bash
git init
```


Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/semasuka/Credit-card-approval-prediction-classification.git
```

enter the project directory

```bash
cd Credit-card-approval-prediction-classification
```

Create a conda virtual environment and install all the packages from the environment.yml (recommended)

```bash
conda env create --prefix <env_name> --file assets/environment.yml
```

Activate the conda environment

```bash
conda activate <env_name>
```

List all the packages installed

```bash
conda list
```
